station-goal-shuttle =
    Your shift's goal for today is to build a pilotable shuttle with all necessary survival gear, including atmospherics.
    It's likely the Supply department will have to order the necessary materials for Engineering and Science.
    The R&D department should provide everything required for the shuttle, namely console boards and power infrastructure.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
station-goal-singularity =
    Your shift's goal for today is to construct an additional singularity-based generator, with plans of expanding the station in the future.
    The engineers should construct a containment field with an internal space of 7x7, the Supply department must order the necessary materials and equipment.
    The singularity must generate net positive power, aiming for 8 radiation collectors.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
station-goal-solar-panels =
    Your shift's goal is to organize a backup power system based on solar panels.
    The Supply department is to provide the necessary materials for Engineering to construct at least two additional solar wings.
    The solar wing output must be isolated from the rest of the station with a SMES for each.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
station-goal-artifacts =
    Your shift's goal is to locate, research and contain alien artifacts.
    The Supply department should order artifact containers [color=yellow]IMMEDIATELY.[/color]
    Salvage will be required to scavenge alien artifacts they find using the salvage magnet. Engineering and the rest of the crew should look out for incoming artifacts.
    After successfully containing an artifact and delivering it to Science, the department is to research artifacts using the artifact laboratory in as great detail as possible and document their properties.
    At least two fully researched and documented artifacts are to be delivered to Central Command via escape shuttle.
    Recommended fields for an artifact's research document:
    - Visual description
    - Properties (per-depth)
    - Notes
    - Full name and job title of the researcher
    Each research document should be stamped by the Research Director or the (acting) Captain in lieu of a RD.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
station-goal-bank =
    Your shift's goal is to construct and deploy a storage pod containing advanced technology and supplies.
    Since the storage pod will be travelling in deep space, you're heavily advised to reinforce its hull, one stray meteor shouldn't destroy its functionality.
    The pod is to contain four crates:
    - an advanced medical chemicals crate
    - a high-yield seeds crate, complete with basic hydroponics tools
    - a freezer crate with various nutritious foodstuffs
    - a computer/machine board crate (with two boards of each type you include)
    Make sure the pod's contents are intact until the evac shuttle arrives.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
station-goal-zoo =
    Your shift's goal is to improve the recreational abilities of the station.
    The engineering department is to build a zoo in close proximity to the dormitories or the bar with three cages of animals ordered from Cargo.
    Supply the animals with food, a cleanbot and everything else the species you're containing needs for survival.
    Glory to Nanotrasen!
